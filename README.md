 # Bot Battlr
Welcome to **Bot Battlr**, the one and only spot in the known universe where you can custom build your own Bot Army!

## Instructions
For this project, youâ€™ll be building out a React application that displays a list of available bots, among other features
 
 ## Topics tested in this Code Challenge:
 
-Implement a mini web app to practice components, props, state, events, and data fetching in react
  ## Core Deliverables
As a user, I should be able to:

- See profiles of all bots rendered in `BotCollection`.

- Add an individual bot to my army by clicking on it. The selected bot should

  render in the `YourBotArmy` component. The bot can be enlisted only **once**.

  The bot **does not** disappear from the `BotCollection`.

- Release a bot from my army by clicking on it. The bot disappears from the

  `YourBotArmy` component.

- Discharge a bot from their service forever, by clicking the red button marked

  "x", which would delete the bot both from the backend and from the

  `YourBotArmy` on the frontend.
